*Question 1*  

From: marissa@startup.com  
Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Hi Marissa,

Thanks for the feedback! I understand the need for efficiency with quick actions like clearing and deleting indexes. While I pass this on to the product team, you might find the API section at the top of this page (https://www.algolia.com/doc/) helpful as a workaround to streamline your process through API calls. We can schedule a call, and I’d be happy to walk you through it!

Let me know if you’d like to chat further.

Best,
Tim

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Hi Carrie,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely understand the urgency. It looks like the record size might be causing the issue, particularly with the additional metadata being included. We can address this by either splitting the metadata into smaller segments or minimizing non-essential data during ingestion. If this information is critical, we can explore further options.

Let’s jump on a call so I can review the situation right away and collaborate with you on the best approach. Please let me know a convenient time.

For more information, you can also refer to our documentation here: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/.

Best,
Tim

Can you fix it please?

Hi Marc,

Thanks for reaching out. Let's get this corrected. Based on the error, it looks like the `searchkit` library may not be defined or loaded correctly. Have there been any recent changes in your configuration or dependencies?

I suggest checking https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/react/ for proper setup steps and verifying that the library is included in your build correctly. I’m here to assist further—just let me know when you'd like to jump on a call and troubleshoot together.

Best regards,  
Tim
